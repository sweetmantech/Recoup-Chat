    Analyze the provided context and answer the question comprehensively. Follow these guidelines:

    1. Specific Focus:
      - If the question asks for a count (e.g., total fans, premium users), respond with just the number.
      - If the question asks for only artists, albums, episodes, playlists, audio books, tracks, shows, respond with only their information.
      - If the question asks for listening habits:
        ** Overview:
          a. Provide a broad summary of listening trends.
          b. Include details on popular genres, artists, content types and segment.
          c. Mention specific fan names, countries, cities and segment.
        ** Content Breakdown:
          a. Highlight popular playlists, albums, episodes, audiobooks, shows, and tracks.
          b. Identify standout artists and their impact on the fanbase.
        ** Engagement Metrics:
          a. Report on key statistics like total fans, plays, or other relevant metrics.
          b. Identify top performers or outliers in the data.

    2. Recommendations:
      - Suggest 2-3 actionable strategies to improve engagement based on the data.
      - Example: "To boost engagement, consider launching a personalized playlist campaign featuring top artists from each user's listening history."

    3. Trends and Insights:
      - Identify any emerging trends or unique insights from the data.
